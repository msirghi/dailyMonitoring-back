1. UserEntity - should we add private List<TaskData> tasks = new ArrayList<>() there?
2. Check the OneToMany and ManyToOne relations
3. @JsonProperty("dates")
   private List<LocalDateTime> dates = new ArrayList<>(); is it correct to user List for dates
4. What if the task is not repeated , what should we use in that case?
